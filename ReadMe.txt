<h2>  About: </h2>

>Find your "BestestDog" roaming in the forests, lost, scared, and looking for treats....

>What treats might you ask?

YummyBones & BestestStick!

>That is right, the BestestDog loves these things and will tame pretty quick once finding them and be your forever friend.
>When your BestestDog is happy he will even carry his own BestestStick!
